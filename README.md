# FYAD_ARMA
Repo for work on FYAD Arma servers. Check the readme for info on versioning syntax, folder structure, and change logs.

==Versioning Info==  
Versions should be numbered with the following syntax: X.Y.Z  
  -The first should indicate major feature changes (e.g. adding or removing an entire mod)  
  -The second should indicate major configuration changes (e.g. adding or removing modules of mods, significant gameplay changes, etc.)  
  -The third should indicate minor configuration changes (e.g. balancing, small fixes, loot table tweaks, etc.)  
    
==Folder Structure==  
Folders include both packed and unpacked pbos. When you make a change to the unpacked pbo, please pack it and make a backup of the old pbo. You can delete the old backup (note: if you use PBO Manager, it will do this for you automatically).
